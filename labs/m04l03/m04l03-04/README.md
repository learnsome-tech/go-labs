# m04l03-04 · A non blocking poll

**Lesson:** [The select Statement](https://learnsome.tech/learn/go-course/m04l03) (lesson 4.3, module 4: Concurrency and Context) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can wait on several channel operations and keep a concurrent worker responsive.

In the lesson: The buffered channel has no value waiting, so the receive case is not ready. The default case runs immediately and reports no update. This is a useful one time poll, such as checking whether a status event has already arrived before continuing. For repeated polling, add a ticker or a sleep so the loop yields time to other work.

- [`starter/go.mod`](starter/go.mod)
- [`starter/main.go`](starter/main.go): the listing from the lesson
- [`starter/run.sh`](starter/run.sh): the command the lesson ran
- [`starter/verification.json`](starter/verification.json)

- [`check.json`](check.json): how `./check` runs and checks this lab

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m04l03/m04l03-04/starter`
2. Read `main.go`.
3. Run it: `go run .`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m04l03-04`.

## Expected output

```text
no update
```

## How to check

`./check m04l03-04` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `go run .` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
