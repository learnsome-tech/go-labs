# m04l03-02 · Selecting a result or a timeout

**Lesson:** [The select Statement](https://learnsome.tech/learn/go-course/m04l03) (lesson 4.3, module 4: Concurrency and Context) · Pro  
**Check:** Graded

## Goal

You can wait on several channel operations and keep a concurrent worker responsive.

In the lesson: The select waits for either a result or a timer. The worker sends quickly, so the result case wins and prints ready. If the worker took longer than the timer, the timeout case would run instead. This is the basic responsive shape for a network check: wait for useful work, but always keep an escape path for a caller that cannot wait forever.

- [`starter/main.go`](starter/main.go): the listing from the lesson

## Steps

1. Go to the starter: `cd labs/m04l03/m04l03-02/starter`
2. Read `main.go`.
3. Run it: `go run .`.
4. Check it from the repository root: `./check m04l03-02`.

## Expected output

```text
ready
```

## How to check

`./check m04l03-02` copies `starter/` into a scratch directory and runs `go run .` there, the way the site's lab sandbox does: that directory is the working directory and `HOME`, `LANG=C.UTF-8`, `TZ=UTC`, a limit of 10 seconds and 256 KiB of output per stream.

It passes when the output matches `expected.txt` by the site's rules, within the limits. Standard output is compared line by line; spaces at the end of a line and blank lines at the end do not count. If that differs, standard output followed by standard error is compared with Python traceback frames and blank lines set aside, so a lesson that shows an error passes when your program prints the same error. A pass here is a pass on the site.
